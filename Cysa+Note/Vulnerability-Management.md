* Which vulnerabilities must be remediated in order to have clean scan under **PCI DSS** standards?
  * Critical and high vulnerabilities
* What should you do before **patching for vulnerabilities**?
  * Deploy the patch in a test environment and then conduct a staged rollout in production
* **Banner grabbing scans** are notorious for resulting in false positive reports.
* CVSS Common vulnerability scoring system(score low to high)
  * Access Vector (AV) metric describes the method an attacker would use to exploit the vulnerability
    * Local
    * Adjacent Network
    * Network
  * Access complexity (AC) metric describes the difficulty an attacker would have to exploit the vulnerability.
    * High
    * Medium
    * Low
  * Authentication (Au) metric describes the number of times an attacker would have to authenticate
    * Multiple
    * Single
    * None
  * Confidentiality (C) Metric describes the impact to confidentiality of data processed by the system
    * None
    * Partial
    * Complete
  * Integrity (I) Metric describes the impact to integrity of data processed by the system
    * None
    * Partial
    * Complete
  * Availability (A) Metric describes the impact to availability of the system
    * None
    * Partial
    * Complete
  * Example of CVSS
    * 10.0 (CVSS2#AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C)
* Agent-based monitoring provides a detailed view of the system's configuration from an internal perspective and is likely to provide more accurate results.
* GPO centralized configuration management tool, for updating large scale of machines.
